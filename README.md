XIAO ESP32C3 based Wi-Fi Switch

**Source code that accompanies [A Wi-Fi Switch for Domoticz using a XIAO ESP32C3 - Part 1](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c3_wifi_switch_1_en.html)**

## Overview of the Wi-Fi Switch

The goal is to try to reproduce the basic functionality of Theo Arends' powerful Tasmota software which is used in many home automation devices. Admittedly, this is such an ambitious goal, that it will be approached in a number of steps and in the end the result will be far less accomplished. The image below shows the interaction between the microcontroller board, a XIAO ESP32C3, with an attached push button, a light level sensor, and a temperature and humidity sensor. As can be seen, it is connected to web browsers and a Domoticz home automation server.

 It's not just a matter of toggling a LED on and off with a button on a Web page; numerous examples can be found on the Web. Whenever the state of the light is changed locally with the button, the light's status has to be updated on the Web page displayed by all clients connected to the Web server and in the home automation system. Similarly, if the toggle button on a client's Web page is clicked, then the hardware controlling the light must be activated accordingly and the light's status must be updated in the home automation system and on all connected clients' Web page simultaneously. Likewise, if the virtual light switch in the home automation system is toggled on or off, the actual relay on the Wi-Fi switch must be updated and the new status of the light must be shown on all connected clients' Web pages.

## Projects 


### 01_simplified_hdw_version

In this first iteration of the ESP32-C3 firmware, a hardware abstraction layer is built to handle 
  - a normally open push button,
  - a DHT20 temperature and humidity sensor connected over the IÂ²C serial bus,
  - a light sensor based on the LS06-S.


A future layer will include substitute parts for the sensors.

In addition the firmware will include an asynchronous web server capable of handling multiple clients at the same time.

This project corresponds to sections 1 to 6 of [A Wi-Fi Switch for Domoticz using a XIAO ESP32C3 - Part 1](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c3_wifi_switch_1_en.html).


### 02_basic_wifi_switch

Integration of the Wi-Fi switch into the home automation system Domoticz is added in this second iteration of the ESP32-C3 firmware. Communication with the Domoticz server is done with HTTP requests.

Domoticz can be used to easily modify the behaviour of the Wi-Fi switch so that it becomes a timed light which stays off after a given period of time or an auxiliary light that gets turned on and off whenever another Domoticz controlled switch is turned on or off. It is also very easy to transform the Wi-Fi switch into a night light that turns on at dusk and back off at sunrise in Domoticz. The [lua](lua/) directory contains a dzVents Lua script that turns the Wi-Fi switch on or off based on the light level measured by the on-board sensor.

The [lua](lua/) directory contains a dzVents Lua script that automatically adjusts the humidity status displayed for all Domoticz supported devices that measure temperature and humidity and optionally barometric pressure. 

This project corresponds to sections 7 and 8 of [A Wi-Fi Switch for Domoticz using a XIAO ESP32C3 - Part 1](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c3_wifi_switch_1_en.html).


### 03_alt_wifi_switch

This third project is project 2 but with a different hardware abstraction layer. It can handle three types of temperature and humidity sensors and two types of light level sensors. Additionally, a temperature and humidity sensor can be emulated and the same is possible with the light level sensor. Finally, a rolling average of the light level measurements can be enabled to smooth out fluctuations caused by clouds or other passing shadows. 

This project corresponds to section 10 of [A Wi-Fi Switch for Domoticz using a XIAO ESP32C3 - Part 1](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c3_wifi_switch_1_en.html).
